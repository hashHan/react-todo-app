## React todo app for coding test

#I made this todo app for coding test.

1. I used SCSS, I didn't use UI framework to practice pure css. 
2. I avoided media query to practice other css functionalities for responsiveness.
3. I didn't use redux to practice prop propagation.
4. I mixed AXIOS and FIREBASE SDK to practice both.


Deployment: <https://react-todo-han.firebaseapp.com/>

NEXT MAYBE: 
1. Fine tuning for css.
2. Add some functionalities like authentication if I need it.
3. Apply progressive web app.
